Tambola is a popular version of Bingo and Housie which is played widely across India and Pakistan. 
The caller reads out the numbers that are randomly drawn to the audience. 
The players cross the number off their ticket if they have it after each number is called out.

This program can generate the Housie/Tambola.
Tickets taking an input from the user to generate the number of rows and column in the tickets.

:Housie Ticket Rules:

Now there are some rules to generate housie tickets 
and 
you can't just randomly put 15 numbers in any boxes of your choice. 
So, let's see the rules and then create a Java cODE that will generate such housie ticketS for us.

RULE #1 - Each row cannot have more than 5 numbers.

RULE #2 - Each column is assigned a range of numbers only:
(ex. 1-10 can appear only in column 1)

RULE #3 - In a specific column, numbers must be arranged in ascending order from top to bottom.
